# SAMPLE REACT SHOP-APP


This is a sample e-commerce shop Single-Page-App(SPA) made with **ReactJS** and **[create-react-app][CRA]** and tools in order to test and demonstrate how React-app should normally be structured and work. The working app can be found visiting http://e47shop.firebaseapp.com
Basically the app was made using very popular and essential libraries and tools for most React SPA, including:

  - create-react-app by Facebook, with Babel and Webpack included
  - Firebase
  - React-Router
  - React-Redux & Redux-thunk
  - Redux-form
  - React-carousel
  - Lodash
  - and some others...




Open package.json for details. 



## Installation
Nothing special, just the usual routine:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/vutran1710/Sample_react_app
$ cd Sample_react_app
$ yarn
$ yarn start
```
or if you dont have yarn just yet...
```sh
$ npm i
$ npm start
```
optimize the bundle with:
```sh
$ yarn build
```
or...
```sh
$ npm run build
```
For the moment, there is no code-coverage. Sorry for that. Will be implemented later.

## App (shop) features
- An auto-transitional carousel at its home-page
- A Shop-browsing component with Product-filter function that will filter product displayed on screen in sync with whatever user types to the Filter form
- A Cart component where user can see what they have picked so far and the total money they will have to pay should they proceed to payment
- An about page which is under-construction.
- A login page where the admin can log in and add more products to the shop

## Todos
 - Write Tests
 - Wait until I think of something more funny to add.
